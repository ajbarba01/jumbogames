    "The shortcuts surface: the keybind registry rendered as a grouped, searchable modal card — and, when the caller passes an `editing` seam, the place binds are rebound.",
  useWhen: [
    "The app-wide shortcut summon (ctrl+/) — pass the same registry table that drives dispatch.",
    "Rebinding: pass `editing`. Reference and editor are ONE surface, so a bind is never discoverable in one place and changeable in another.",

    "Naming one shortcut inline — Kbd.",
    "Owning the key vocabulary or the conflict policy — those come in through `editing`; this card renders and captures, it does not decide.",

  anatomy:
    'A height-capped ModalShell card: caps header with reset-all + a ghost close, an autofocused filter field, then the scrolling rows — one group header per bind group, and per row: label, a scope tag where the bind only answers somewhere ("in settings"), and the CHORD FIELD: the Kbd chips (or "unbound") inside a bordered control you click into to record a new chord, plus a reset for a customised bind. The chord is the control — there is no separate record button — and while recording it holds the chord heard and a line stating what Enter will do (including whose bind it would take).',

    "open",
    "closed (unmounted by the caller)",

  accessibility:
    "Labelled dialog via ModalShell; the registry prop guarantees no bind exists without appearing here. Capture swallows every key while it runs (Escape cancels the recording rather than closing the card) so a chord under test can never also fire the command it names.",
