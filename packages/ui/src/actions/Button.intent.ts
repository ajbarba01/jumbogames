    "Any clickable control that commits an action: submit, confirm, deny, run, start, or trigger a menu.",
    "primary for the one accent action per view · quiet for the workhorse confirm · outline for secondary/deny · block for raised square utilities · ghost for chrome-adjacent icons · text for ink-only toolbar controls.",

    "The control navigates to another location rather than committing an action.",
    "The control needs a loading state — this vocabulary has none; callers disable instead.",

  anatomy:
    "A native <button> whose face (color/border/hover/press) and geometry (text padding or icon square) are selected per variant; disabled swaps to the off face with no hover, no press, no pointer.",
